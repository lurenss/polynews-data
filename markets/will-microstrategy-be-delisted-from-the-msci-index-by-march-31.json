  "title": "Microstrategy delisted from MSCI index by March 31?",
  "description": "This market will resolve to “Yes” if MicroStrategy is removed from either the MSCI World Index or the MSCI USA Index at any point by March 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, it will resolve to “No.”\n\nIf MicroStrategy is transferred between indexes (e.g., from MSCI World to another MSCI index), that will also count as a removal for the purposes of this market.\n\nAn official MSCI announcement of removal or transfer will be sufficient for a ‘Yes’ resolution.\n\nThe resolution source will be official MSCI communication or a consensus of credible reporting.\n",

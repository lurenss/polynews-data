  "description": "This market refers to the cricket match between India and USA scheduled for February 7 2026 in T20 World Cup.\n\nThis market resolves according to the finalized match result as published by https://www.icc-cricket.com/.  \n\nDLS/DRS, over-rate penalties, forfeit/walkover, or any other on-field ruling that leads the competition to declare a winner are treated as ordinary wins.\n\nIf the match ends tied and the playing conditions provide an on-field tiebreak (e.g., Super Over), the winner determined by that tiebreak will be used for resolution. If the match ends tied and no on-field tiebreak is used or available under the playing conditions (e.g., group-stage ODI with no Super Over), the market will resolve 50-50.\n\nIf the match is postponed/rescheduled, the market remains open until the listed fixture is completed. If the match is permanently canceled or abandoned or otherwise is completed without a winner, the market resolves 50-50\n",

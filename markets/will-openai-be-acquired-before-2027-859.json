  "description": "This market will resolve to “Yes” if credible reporting confirms that any entity enters into an agreement to acquire the listed company by December 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nMergers where the listed company is subsumed by another entity will count toward a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nAn announced agreement between the listed company and an acquiring entity will qualify for a “Yes” resolution, regardless of whether the acquisition is ultimately completed.\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market is official information from the listed company and/or its leadership; however, a consensus of credible reporting will also be used.",
